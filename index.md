# Research

I am a post-doctoral researcher at H. John Heinz III College, Carnegie
Mellon University and Católica-Lisbon School of Business and
Economics. My research interests lie on the economics of technology
adoption and diffusion. I currently pursue two streams of research,
namely on the [Economic Impacts of ICTs in Education](#education), and on [Peer Influence and Product Adoption in Large Social Networks](#influence).

## Economic Impacts of ICTs in Education

I am interested in the role of information and communication
technologies (ICTs) in students' learning experience, in how these
technologies affect students' educational outcomes and skill
acquisition. I am also interested in the community level effects of
providing students with these technologies, namely in terms of home
Internet adoption and adults' skills acquisition.

## Peer Influence and Product Adoption in Large Social Networks

I am interested in quantifying the actual net effects of peer
influence in large mobile and online social
networks. Methodologically, identification of social influence in
observational data is a difficult task, mainly due to phenomena such
as homophily or other sources of correlation. I am interested in
alternative methods to disentangle influence from these other effects.
