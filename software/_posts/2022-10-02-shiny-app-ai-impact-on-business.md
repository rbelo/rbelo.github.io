title: "Shiny App: AI Impact on Business-Exploring Prediction and Judgment"
---

I've developed a [Shiny App](https://rbelo.shinyapps.io/ai-business/) that explores the implications of the quality of a classifier. Features include:
  - ROC, cumulative response and Lift Curves
  - Benefit/Cost matrix and Profit curves
  - Discrimination and fairness analysis

 - TODO: Improve the way prediction errors are calculated.
