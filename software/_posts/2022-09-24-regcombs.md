title: "REGCOMBS: An R package to display regression results"
---

[REGCOMBS](https://github.com/rbelo/regcombs) (short for REGression COMBinationS) is an R package that runs and displays the results of different combinations of regressions without us having to explicitly detail everything. Think of it as a way to test multiple specifications and avoid verbosity.
