#+TITLE: Rodrigo Belo's Website

* README

This site is currently hosted at http://rbelo.github.io which is (apparently) available on http://rodrigobelo.com.

This is a Jekyll site, thus I have placed here all the content that may change. To publish the site we need to:
 1. Tangle this file (C-c C-v C-t) so that all the configuration and content files are created
 2. Commit the new and updated files on the local git repository
 3. Push the changes to the Github repository. This will publish the changes.

I am a Professor of Information Systems at [Nova School of Business and Economics](http://novasbe.pt), Universidade Nova de Lisboa.

My research focuses on digital technologies, on their effects on individual behavior and interactions (e.g., in media consumption, online dating, and technology-mediated learning), and on the implications for firms, their industries, and society at large.

Rodrigo Belo is Professor of Information Systems at [Nova School of Business and Economics](http://novasbe.pt), Universidade Nova de Lisboa.

Rodrigo's research focuses on how digital technologies mediate interactions among economic agents. His research interests include how digitization and AI technologies are changing how individuals interact and influence each other (e.g., in media consumption, online dating, and technology-mediated learning), and on the implications for firms, their industries, and society at large. His work has been published in top journals in the field such as Management Science, Marketing Science, and MIS Quarterly. Rodrigo has led and collaborated in multiple projects with established firms and startups in the online and telecommunications sectors. His engagements include the design and deployment of large-scale real world randomized experiments to assess the effectiveness of marketing campaigns and to optimize online user engagement.

My research is motivated by the choices individuals face upon the introduction of new technologies and products and by the aggregate dynamics accruing from these disruptions. I am interested in the digitization process and in how its outcomes are shaping the ways individuals interact with technology and with each other. I am equally interested in the methods that aim at identifying causal effects, namely in randomized experiments. In particular, I am interested randomized experiments in networked environments, in which interactions among treatment units create additional challenges. I am also interested in the combination of randomized experiments with machine learning methods to identify heterogeneous treatment effects and to achieve optimal treatment assignment to each treatment unit.

[REGCOMBS](https://github.com/rbelo/regcombs) (short for REGression COMBinationS) is an R package that runs and displays the results of different combinations of regressions without us having to explicitly detail everything. Think of it as a way to test multiple specifications and avoid verbosity.
