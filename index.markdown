I am a Professor of Information Systems at [Nova School of Business and Economics](http://novasbe.pt), Universidade Nova de Lisboa.

My research focuses on digital technologies, on their effects on individual behavior and interactions (e.g., in media consumption, online dating, and technology-mediated learning), and on the implications for firms, their industries, and society at large.
