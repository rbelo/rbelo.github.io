I am Associate Professor at the Department of Technology and
Operations Management at Rotterdam School of Management of the Erasmus
University.

My research focuses on the effects of information systems on
organizations and on the impacts of social network structures and peer
influence on consumer behavior.

I have a PhD in Technological Change and Entrepreneurship from
Carnegie Mellon University, an MSc in Engineering and Public Policy
from Carnegie Mellon University, and a BSc in Computer Science and
Engineering from Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico, University of Lisbon.
Before joining the academia I worked as a software engineer and
analyst in the transportation and government sectors.
