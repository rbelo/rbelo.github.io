I am a Professor of Information Systems in the group of Operations, Information and Technology at [Nova School of Business and Economics](http://novasbe.pt), Universidade Nova de Lisboa.

My research focuses on digital technologies, on their effects on individual behavior and interactions (e.g., in media consumption, online dating, and technology-mediated learning), and on the implications for firms, their industries, and society at large.

<!-- I have a PhD in Technological Change and Entrepreneurship from Carnegie Mellon University, an MSc in Engineering and Public Policy from Carnegie Mellon University, and a BSc in Computer Science and Engineering from Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico, University of Lisbon. Before joining the academia I worked as a software engineer and analyst in the transportation and government sectors. -->
