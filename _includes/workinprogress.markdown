_Generative AI and Student Performance: Evidence from a Large-Scale Intervention in a Digital Business Course_, with Dimitrios Tsekouras

The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI), especially Large Language Models (LLM) such as ChatGPT, has created the potential for disrupting established practices in multiple areas such as the labor market, healthcare, and education \cite{eloundou2023gpts}. In the context of education, the use of AI tools based on LLMs can transform the way students learn, with, e.g., the implementation of virtual tutors helping students understand new concepts or helping students draft essays and improve their writing skills. In this paper, we examine the impact of ChatGPT on student performance in the context of a large course on Digital Business at a European business school. We use data from two editions of the course. The first edition of the course was taught before the introduction of ChatGPT in November 2022, while for the second edition, the use of ChatGPT was made mandatory for the first essay and optional for the second. We assess the impact of the use of ChatGPT by comparing essay grades across the two cohorts of students. We find that the use of ChatGPT has a negative impact in all rubric attributes for the first essay, except for writing quality. For the second essay, the use of ChatGPT has a positive impact on writing quality but no impact on the other rubric attributes. We also find that weaker students benefit the most from the use of ChatGPT w.r.t. total grade, evidence, and relevance.
