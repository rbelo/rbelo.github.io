My research is motivated by the choices individuals face upon the introduction of new technologies and products and by the aggregate dynamics accruing from these disruptions. I am interested in the digitization process and in how its outcomes are shaping the ways individuals interact with technology and with each other. I am equally interested in the methods that aim at identifying causal effects, namely in randomized experiments. In particular, I am interested randomized experiments in networked environments, in which interactions among treatment units create additional challenges. I am also interested in the combination of randomized experiments with machine learning methods to identify heterogeneous treatment effects and to achieve optimal treatment assignment to each treatment unit.

<!-- I currently pursue two streams of research. A first stream of research focuses on Pricing, Advertising and Peer Influence in Digital Platforms. I am interested in understanding how platforms and products shape individual behavior, and how individuals influence each other in online settings. I have done work on the role of peer influence in large social networks in diverse contexts, applying both novel identification methods for observational data, and large scale randomized experiments. I have also done work on online member-get-member referral policies and on advertising. -->
